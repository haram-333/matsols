A UNIQUE PRACTICE-BASED FILMMAKING MA
Unlike conventional film courses, our MA in Filmmaking embraces a “Practice as Research” approach, allowing you to gain hands-on experience by completing four self-designed film projects. From screenwriting and directing to producing and documentary filmmaking, you’ll develop real-world skills while building a professional portfolio that reflects your creative vision.
This one-year (full-time) or two-year (part-time) course programme offers a structured yet flexible learning environment. Instead of a rigid, pre-determined curriculum, you’ll follow a bespoke framework that requires personal goal-setting, strategic planning, and independent research. You’ll have the freedom to tailor your learning experience, taking full responsibility for designing and executing your own pathway.
With guidance from mentors, you will:
•	Drive your own independent study
•	Engage in peer-to-peer collaboration
•	Select relevant open courses or Project Skills Labs to enhance your skills
•	Develop and implement a strategic learning plan aligned with your goals and university postgraduate requirements
Assessment and Study Credits

Create hands-on projects such as short films, scripts, mood boards, marketing strategies, business plans, or crowdfunding campaigns, accompanied by a Reflective Report

Overview
This programme is a flexible learning environment: with a set framework and with the content following a bespoke curriculum. It is NOT a traditional, pre-determined curriculum that provides what you need to know or tells you what to do. It requires a high level of personal goal-setting, planning, research and resourcefulness to design your own learning pathway.
You will negotiate the content of your learning with your mentors,
drive your own independent study throughout,
engage in peer-to-peer group study,
selectively choose open courses or Project Skills Labs to augment your learning,
while taking responsibility to initiate, develop and execute a strategic learning plan that you’ve designed and negotiated to meet both your learning needs and university postgraduate requirements.
Marks and study credits are given for work which students submit at the end of each of six modules. The first two module assignments are DeMontfort University requirements. Students then negotiate the remaining modules.

Programme Structure
The Programme provides a structure for your learning. You will be able to negotiate the content of your modules.
1.	Learning Plan -15 credits, 150 hrs.
In this first module, the student is expected to develop and pitch to the university a Learning Plan that will act as a roadmap of individual study over two years part-time. The Learning Plan will form the link between the individual’s project & career goals and the Programme’s academic and modular frameworks.
2.	Research Paper -15 credits, 150 hrs.
This second module focuses on understanding proper research techniques, a lifelong skill to support a filmmaking, media and storytelling career. Students investigate a topic that is foundational to their chosen area of study.
3.	Negotiated Modules (x 3) -30 credits each, 300 hrs each.
Students design 3 separate modules negotiated with their mentors and advisors. Together these modules lead developmentally toward the student’s final masters project. The negotiated modules typically combine research and applied practice, testing or executing some aspect of writing, directing or producing.
4.	Negotiated Masters Module -60 credits, 600 hrs.
The final Masters is the culmination of the student’s work in the Programme and brings together the learning done in the previous modules.

What our graduates are saying?
“I got an opportunity to shoot and debut my short film at the Raindance Film Festival. In this programme I was clearly able to identify my core competency and gain a greater understanding of my craft.”
– S. Bandaranayake, Sri Lanka
“As an M.A Graduate student of Raindance, I can attest that this program has benefited me in both academic and practical development as a professional filmmaker. I chose this program above any other University graduate film program because it offers me the diversity and the structure to actually learn how to become a writer, producer and director in the real world.
I have thus far achieved several milestones in market research, and I am well on my way to producing my first feature film.
In addition, the program offers flexibility and a support system that is necessary to my connections and overall personal achievements. As a full time parent, the program flexibility is fundamental to my success.
I highly recommended this Masters Degree Program to any person serious in pursuing a career as an independent filmmaker in Canada.”
– Kimberly Hennessy, Montreal, Producer, Screenwriter
“Having over a decade of corporate experience in Toronto’s financial sector the M. A. program offered me an opportunity to enhance my experience and career potential whether partially or fully transitioning into filmmaking, due to its flexible nature.
This self-directed, but academically and professionally guided, program allows students to structure their studies to build upon their professional backgrounds or to explore and exponentially grow their understanding of new concepts. The ultimate result being a thesis that provides potential insight and growth to the film industry and a multitude of opportunities for the students.
What I hope and believe I will get out of this program at its end: academic growth and certification, unique industry expertise and recognition, strategic networking, and career opportunities.”
– Wilson Chan, Director, Toronto, Canada
“Having gone from a Saturday Film School-inspired film buff to an MA Filmmaking alumni, I get the hype. Raindance forced me out of my comfort zone, and into a position of taking the bull by the horns. That led to me making my debut feature, only a short while after completing the course.” – Chris Mul
“My docuseries was commissioned after graduating as a direct consequence of my research in the Raindance MA in Filmmaking, and my final thesis. I’m very grateful for the experience.”
– Miles Crossman
