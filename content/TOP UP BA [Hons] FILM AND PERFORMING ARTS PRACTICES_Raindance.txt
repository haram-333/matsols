Programme Structure
Professional Practice is fundamental to this course. Creative artefacts (short films, screenplays, performance projects, showreels etc) are the mainstay of learning and assessment.
Students will achieve advanced level practical proficiency within a chosen Film and Performing Arts pathway, as well as developing undergraduate level independent study skills. They will research practice within their chosen specialisation (screenwriting, directing, producing or acting) and produce large-scale projects, films or screenplays. The teaching is made up of practical workshops, masterclasses, lectures, seminars and individual tutorials and all sessions are led by lecturers with professional industry experience.
Semester 1
Module 1 – Critical Research (15 credits)
This module gives you the opportunity to carry out of a piece of critical research into your chosen specialisation within film & TV production, to provide a practical, as well as academic, exploration of an area of professional interest to you. The module will also help you to develop your skills of enquiry, reflection, problem solving and academic writing, which will be valuable preparation for your reflection in future modules.
Module 2 – Specialist Negotiated Practical Project (45 credits)
This module provides you with an opportunity to create a unique project that explores a chosen area of specialisation, with a mind to developing your practical skills. Possible projects that can be undertaken may include: a short test film, a music video or test advert, showreel scenes, rehearsal workshops, script development/ writers rooms/ treatments, pitch decks or directing workshops.
Semester 2
Module 3 – Film & TV Business Practices (15 credits)
This module examines the film marketplace, the industry and the job roles available to you in your future career. It is designed to help you navigate the current industry landscape, the opportunities, and the legal and financial considerations you will need to consider as you embark on a career in the film and TV industry. Assessment is via an essay, or short video, that takes the form of a critical case study, or a practitioner profile, from within your chosen specialisation.
Module 4 – Film Practices Final Project (45 credits)
This module provides you with an opportunity to creatively explore an individually chosen area of specialisation and to produce a large scale, professional standard creative artefact. You are able to choose one of four options: (a) a producing project; or (b) a screenwriting project; or (c) a directing project; or (d) an acting project.
The aim of the finished project should be to produce an effective ‘calling card’ to aid entry into the industry. Whether, as a director, actor, screenwriter or producer, the expectation is that all final projects will be produced to a highly professional standard suitable for public/ festival screening and/or future professional production.
