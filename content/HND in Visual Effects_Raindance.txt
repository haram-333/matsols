Key Information
The Higher National Diploma (HND) is an internationally recognised UK qualification that provides specialist vocational learning at levels 4 and 5. HNDs are delivered by universities and colleges, and are considered the equivalent of the first two years of a three-year university degree course. Students can often progress onto the final year of the BA Top Up degree programme to obtain a full B.A. (Hons).________________________________________

Programme Structure
Module A: Process and Practice [Year 1]
Assessment 1: Concept and Development – 85 Credits
This unit introduces you to the creative and technical foundations of visual effects. You will learn how to develop a VFX scene from concept to screen, exploring shot planning, to integrate VFX. Through pre-visualisation and storyboarding, you will interpret scripts into visual sequences and prepare VFX breakdowns.
You’ll gain skills in 3D modelling, texturing, and lighting, while using industry-standard software such as Autodesk Maya and Z-brush. You will also explore digital compositing concepts using Nuke and After Effects, learning how to plan layers, match live-action plates, and integrate CG assets. The unit culminates in a pre-production portfolio that includes concept art, animatics, and a VFX shot plan. You will also learn the benefits of using AI as a development tool for various aspects of VFX.
Assessment 2: Creative Project – 35 Credits
In this practical production unit, you’ll create a short visual effects sequence or integrated live-action scene. Working from a set brief, you’ll take responsibility for shooting source footage, tracking, keying, and compositing visual elements into a final piece.
You’ll gain hands-on experience with green screen production, camera tracking (MatchMove), digital matte painting, and practical effects integration. Industry tools such as Nuke, DaVinci Resolve Fusion, and Adobe After Effects will be used to complete your composite. You’ll submit a final VFX sequence with an accompanying production journal and reflective evaluation detailing your creative and technical process.
Module B: Professional Creative Practice [Year 2]
Assessment 1: Personal Professional Development – 45 Credits
This unit focuses on collaboration, pipeline workflow, and career development within the visual effects industry. You’ll work as part of a multi-disciplinary production team alongside filmmakers, animators, and sound designers to deliver a live project for an external or simulated client.
You’ll take on professional roles such as VFX supervisor, compositor, or CG generalist, learning how to manage assets, coordinate across departments, and maintain version control using tools such as ShotGrid, Houdini, and DaVinci Resolve Studio. Alongside production work, you’ll develop your personal portfolio and professional online presence, aligning your creative identity with industry expectations.
Assessment 2: Advanced Specialist Practice – 75 Credits
This capstone unit allows you to specialise in an area of visual effects that reflects your career goals, whether compositing, CG environments, 3D character work, or simulation effects. You’ll design, produce, and deliver a substantial VFX sequence or short film showcasing advanced technical ability and artistic direction.
You will lead the process from concept design through to render and post-production, using professional workflows and rendering pipelines (e.g., Arnold, Redshift, Unreal Engine). The unit concludes with a showreel-ready project, pipeline documentation, and a critical reflection, demonstrating both creative maturity and readiness for employment or further study within the screen industries.
