Key Information
The Higher National Diploma (HND) is an internationally recognised UK qualification that provides specialist vocational learning at levels 4 and 5. HNDs are delivered by universities and colleges, and are considered the equivalent of the first two years of a three-year university degree course. Students can often progress onto the final year of the Top UP degree programme to obtain a full B.A. (Hons).________________________________________
Overview
Acting techniques taught
Practical Aesthetics
This technique concentrates on two key ideas: Acting: Before You Think and
Thinking: Before You Act. Whilst studying Script Analysis and Performance Technique, students explore scripts by understanding the story and the written circumstances, and then going through the process of choosing ‘actions’ and making choices that will create a character.
The technique focuses on what is actually happening in the scene and on the pursuit of an action or goal. Developed by David Mamet and William H. Macy, the methodology explores two main elements: what the character is “doing,” and what he/she “wants”. This is distilled down to a playable “action,” which the actor personalizes through what is called an “as if.” The second part of the technique is called Moment: students will complete a variety of exercises, including Repetition, which will help them conquer self-consciousness and teach them how to focus on the other people in a scene, and to act spontaneously and truthfully to that stimuli.
Improvisation – The Five Pillars
Improvisation classes will introduce students to the five basic concepts of improvisation: Specificity, “Yes and…”, Object Work, Emotion and Status.
Improvising, and being comfortable improvising, is fundamental to an actor’s preparation. These classes will introduce students to the power of this skill and allow them to learn how to use it in a way that will help their confidence and their overall acting craft.
Meisner Technique
Meisner Technique takes as it’s basis, what is sometimes called “truthful acting.” Peter Brook refers to this as the “invisible actor”. i.e. acting the truth of a character, not seeking to make them “interesting” or “entertaining”. Sanford Meisner, who developed the method, encouraged his students to live truthfully under any given imaginary circumstance. The approach to the method is to have the actor act on fundamental emotional impulses – their instinct as opposed to their brain.
Stanislavski’s System
Stanislavski was the originator and the father of most modern acting theory. His theories were the starting point for most methodologies that came after, including Meisner and Strassberg. His philosophy, in essence, encourages an actor to use his/her emotional memory when approaching work, asking themselves, “How would I react if this was really happening to me?”
Acting for the Camera
Most traditional training methods for the actor make no allowance for the specificity of screen acting, rather they adopt a ‘one size fits all’ approach, that focuses the student solely on ‘truthfulness’. These classes will look at the specific challenges of acting on screen, as compared to stage. This includes learning how to maintain concentration on a set and not being distracted by a camera and crew, learning how to deliver a performance suitable for the size of shot and the scene, learning how and when to be consistent for continuity, and understanding the importance of character arcs so as not to be confused by shooting out of sequence.
Le Jeu – Techniques from Phillipe Gaulier and Jacques Lecoq
These classes will look at the techniques used by performers such as Sacha Baron Cohen, Leigh Francis and Helena Bonham Carter and is particularly suited to devised work and work that contains ‘movement’ elements. The approach is designed to allow the student to discover the pleasure of performing. There are philosophical principles involved, but it is more about finding the ‘fun’ in acting and performing, or as Philippe Gaulier terms it: “Le Jeu – ‘the game’”.
Voice – Techniques from Cicely Berry
“Speaking is part of a whole: an expression of inner life.” Cicely Berry’s work is based on the conviction that our natural instincts have been crippled from birth by conditioning. She argues, an actor needs precise exercise, and clear understanding, to liberate hidden possibilities and to learn the hard task of being true to the ′instinct of the moment′. Her methodology begins from a simple premise: there is no such thing as a correct voice. “There is no right way––there are only a million wrong ways, which are wrong because they deny what would otherwise be affirmed. Wrong uses of the voice are those that constipate feeling, constrict activity, blunt expression, level out idiosyncrasy, generalize experience, coarsen intimacy.”
Audition Technique
Auditions are the life blood for any actor, and knowing how to approach them in a way that best delivers what the Director looking for is key. The classes aim to allow the student to understand how to prepare for auditions, how to be comfortable and confident when sight reading, and how to ‘work’ the room.
