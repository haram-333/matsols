About
Hair and make-up are essential components of visual storytelling in film and television,
shaping character, period, genre, and realism on screen. This course is delivered as a
specialist pathway within the Pearson BTEC Higher National Diploma in Hair and Make-Up
Artistry, with a clear focus on professional practice for film and television production.
Grounded in Pearson’s nationally recognised qualification framework, the programme
develops core skills in hair styling, make-up application, prosthetics, and special effects,
while contextualising learning specifically for screen-based work. Students explore how
hair and make-up support narrative, character development, and continuity across a range
of production contexts.

Key Information
This course is designed for aspiring hair and make-up artists who want to specialise in film and television production.
It is particularly suited to students interested in character-led make-up, period hair and make-up, prosthetics, special effects, and continuity for screen. The pathway supports those who wish to work within film, television, streaming, and independent production environments.
Aligned with Raindance’s ethos of empowering independent creators, the course encourages students to combine creative skill with professional discipline, preparing them to work confidently within the fast-paced realities of screen production.
