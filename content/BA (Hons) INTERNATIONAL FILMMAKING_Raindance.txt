YEAR 1
Module A: Process and Practice (Year 1)
Assessment 1: Concept and Development (85 Credits)
This unit covers the early stages of filmmaking, from developing original ideas to planning your first short film. You’ll write a script, create a pitch deck, and compile a full pre-production pack, while building skills in storytelling, character development, budgeting, scheduling, and visual planning.
Assessment 2: Creative Project (35 Credits)
In this practical module, you’ll direct and produce a short film based on a set brief, applying your skills across the full production process — from filming and editing to promotion and reflection.

This project mirrors industry practice and marks your first complete film as a director.

In this unit, you’ll specialise in key areas of filmmaking while creating a significant project that showcases your creative and technical development. Whether producing a short film, documentary, or episodic content, you’ll lead the process from concept to completion—managing production, directing talent, and shaping the narrative and visual style. The unit concludes with a portfolio-ready film and critical reflection, demonstrating your readiness for the screen industries or further study.

General info & FAQs
Students studying the International BA Programme would be studying a Higher National Diploma (HND) for the first two years of the degree. The HND is an internationally recognised UK qualification that provides specialist vocational learning at levels 4 and 5. HNDs are delivered by universities and colleges, and are considered the equivalent of the first two years of a three-year university degree course. Students can often progress onto the final year of a degree programme to obtain a full B.Sc./B.A. (Hons). In very specific circumstances, with evidence provided, someone studying the HND may be able to skip the BA year and study on our Masters degree with Raindance. Both the BA and MA courses would be delivered by the Raindance London Campus.
What days do I need to go in?
Although the HND programme is full-time, we have structured it to allow you to work around your work/life commitments. The course runs two days per week, from 10:30 to 17:30.
Raindance Professional courses run at various times during evenings and weekends.
We aim to restrict class sizes to 15 per group. This allows us to run practical workshops and give all our students on-going hands-on support throughout their learning.
Do you offer accomodation?
We offer an optional relocation package that includes flights, visa costs and your first month’s accommodation at each international destination. After this, students have options to relocate depending on their requirements. The packages will be offered during induction and will cost approximately £2,000 per student.
How is the course assessed?
Assessment is through a series of assignments including research modules, hands-on practical exercises and group projects.
Units are interlinked to replicate “real world” scenarios and offer the opportunity for students to build a range of skills to maximise employment opportunities.
Will I need any special equipment or materials?
Although equipment is provided, we advise you to obtain a laptop computer that meets the requirements to run the Adobe Creative Suite.
