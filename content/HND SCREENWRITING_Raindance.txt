Key Information
The Higher National Diploma (HND) is an internationally recognized UK qualification that provides specialist vocational learning at levels 4 and 5. HNDs are delivered by universities and colleges, and are considered the equivalent of the first two years of a three-year university degree course. Students can often progress onto the final year of the BA Top Up degree program to obtain a full B.A. (Hons).
