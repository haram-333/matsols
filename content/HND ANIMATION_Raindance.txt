Programme Structure
Module A: Process and Practice [Year 1]
Assessment 1: Concept and Development – 85 Credits
This unit introduces you to the creative and technical fundamentals of animation. You’ll study the 12 principles of animation, learning how timing, spacing, squash and stretch, and anticipation create the illusion of life. You’ll also explore the history and evolution of animation, from traditional hand-drawn and stop-motion to digital 3D techniques.
You’ll design characters, environments, and storyboards, developing skills in 2D animation using Toon Boom Harmony and Adobe Animate, and in 3D pre-visualisation using Blender or Maya. You’ll produce animatics and short test animations that demonstrate motion, weight, and emotion. The unit concludes with a concept portfolio including character turnarounds, visual development sheets, and a pre-production animation plan.
Assessment 2: Creative Project – 35 Credits
In this practical module, you’ll produce a short animated sequence or microfilm from your own concept. You’ll plan and animate using your preferred medium—2D, 3D, or stop-motion—and integrate sound and post-production to create a cohesive final piece.
You’ll gain experience in camera setup, rigging, lighting, and rendering, as well as compositing and editing using After Effects or DaVinci Resolve. The project culminates in a fully rendered short animation, supported by a production journal and critical reflection documenting your creative process, techniques, and artistic development.
Module B: Professional Creative Practice [Year 2]
Assessment 1: Personal Professional Development – 45 Credits
This unit emphasises teamwork, industry practice, and employability. You’ll collaborate on a professional-level project, working alongside visual effects, sound, and film students to deliver an animated production for an external or simulated client.
You’ll take on professional roles such as animator, character designer, technical director, or production coordinator, gaining experience in asset management and collaborative workflows using tools like ShotGrid, Autodesk Maya, and Blender. Alongside production, you’ll develop a professional portfolio and showreel, preparing for graduate entry into the animation or games industries.
Assessment 2: Advanced Specialist Practice – 75 Credits
This capstone unit allows you to specialise in an area of animation that aligns with your career ambitions—such as 3D character animation, environment design, motion graphics, or stop-motion production. You’ll take your project from concept to completion, applying advanced animation techniques and post-production workflows.
You’ll explore professional rendering pipelines using tools such as Unreal Engine, Arnold, and Redshift, while refining your creative direction and storytelling. The final project will demonstrate technical mastery, creative vision, and professional readiness through a showreel-quality animation, pipeline documentation, and a critical evaluation reflecting on your development as an animator.
This course is subject to validation. You can still apply for this course while it is being approved.
