    overview:
      "Acting techniques taught\nPractical Aesthetics\nThis technique concentrates on two key ideas: Acting: Before You Think and\nThinking: Before You Act. Whilst studying Script Analysis and Performance Technique, students explore scripts by understanding the story and the written circumstances, and then going through the process of choosing \u2018actions\u2019 and making choices that will create a character.\nThe technique focuses on what is actually happening in the scene and on the pursuit of an action or goal. Developed by David Mamet and William H. Macy, the methodology explores two main elements: what the character is \u201cdoing,\u201d and what he/she \u201cwants\u201d. This is distilled down to a playable \u201caction,\u201d which the actor personalizes through what is called an \u201cas if.\u201d The second part of the technique is called Moment: students will complete a variety of exercises, including Repetition, which will help them conquer self-consciousness and teach them how to focus on the other people in a scene, and to act spontaneously and truthfully to that stimuli.\nImprovisation \u2013 The Five Pillars\nImprovisation classes will introduce students to the five basic concepts of improvisation: Specificity, \u201cYes and\u2026\u201d, Object Work, Emotion and Status.\nImprovising, and being comfortable improvising, is fundamental to an actor\u2019s preparation. These classes will introduce students to the power of this skill and allow them to learn how to use it in a way that will help their confidence and their overall acting craft.\nMeisner Technique\nMeisner Technique takes as it\u2019s basis, what is sometimes called \u201ctruthful acting.\u201d Peter Brook refers to this as the \u201cinvisible actor\u201d. i.e. acting the truth of a character, not seeking to make them \u201cinteresting\u201d or \u201centertaining\u201d. Sanford Meisner, who developed the method, encouraged his students to live truthfully under any given imaginary circumstance. The approach to the method is to have the actor act on fundamental emotional impulses \u2013 their instinct as opposed to their brain.\nStanislavski\u2019s System\nStanislavski was the originator and the father of most modern acting theory. His theories were the starting point for most methodologies that came after, including Meisner and Strassberg. His philosophy, in essence, encourages an actor to use his/her emotional memory when approaching work, asking themselves, \u201cHow would I react if this was really happening to me?\u201d\nActing for the Camera\nMost traditional training methods for the actor make no allowance for the specificity of screen acting, rather they adopt a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach, that focuses the student solely on \u2018truthfulness\u2019. These classes will look at the specific challenges of acting on screen, as compared to stage. This includes learning how to maintain concentration on a set and not being distracted by a camera and crew, learning how to deliver a performance suitable for the size of shot and the scene, learning how and when to be consistent for continuity, and understanding the importance of character arcs so as not to be confused by shooting out of sequence.\nLe Jeu \u2013 Techniques from Phillipe Gaulier and Jacques Lecoq\nThese classes will look at the techniques used by performers such as Sacha Baron Cohen, Leigh Francis and Helena Bonham Carter and is particularly suited to devised work and work that contains \u2018movement\u2019 elements. The approach is designed to allow the student to discover the pleasure of performing. There are philosophical principles involved, but it is more about finding the \u2018fun\u2019 in acting and performing, or as Philippe Gaulier terms it: \u201cLe Jeu \u2013 \u2018the game\u2019\u201d.\nVoice \u2013 Techniques from Cicely Berry\n\u201cSpeaking is part of a whole: an expression of inner life.\u201d Cicely Berry\u2019s work is based on the conviction that our natural instincts have been crippled from birth by conditioning. She argues, an actor needs precise exercise, and clear understanding, to liberate hidden possibilities and to learn the hard task of being true to the \u2032instinct of the moment\u2032. Her methodology begins from a simple premise: there is no such thing as a correct voice. \u201cThere is no right way\u2013\u2013there are only a million wrong ways, which are wrong because they deny what would otherwise be affirmed. Wrong uses of the voice are those that constipate feeling, constrict activity, blunt expression, level out idiosyncrasy, generalize experience, coarsen intimacy.\u201d\nAudition Technique\nAuditions are the life blood for any actor, and knowing how to approach them in a way that best delivers what the Director looking for is key. The classes aim to allow the student to understand how to prepare for auditions, how to be comfortable and confident when sight reading, and how to \u2018work\u2019 the room.\nWhat will I study on the course?\nYear 1\nAll students study common modules in their first year.

In particular, you will investigate and analyse how story structures from Aristotle\u2019s \u2018Poetics\u2019 through Vladimir Propp\u2019s \u2018Narratemes\u2019 to Kim Hudson\u2019s \u2018The Virgin\u2019s Promise\u2019 have influenced and shaped character and story development for the big and small screens.

You will learn how to assess, develop, and stress test an idea for a screen work. In the process, you will write premises and one-page pitch documents, and you will present your ideas to your peers and tutors for feedback. You will also undertake a short research project into an aspect of the film or TV industry that will serve as a springboard into the writing.\nWriting the Short Film (30 credits)\nThis module provides you with the opportunity to learn the nuts and bolts of screenwriting, with special attention given to the meta elements \u2013 character, theme, and story.

There will also be an opportunity for you to pitch your work to an industry panel to gain professional feedback.\nThe Art of Adaptation (30 credits)\nThis module provides you with the opportunity to explore adapting a narrative for the screen. You will assess the suitability of source materials from newspaper articles to poems and short stories, and work towards an understanding of what makes an effective adaptation. You will also develop an awareness and understanding of the difference in approach to adapting material for the screen as opposed to creating original works, and you will write a mission statement (that serves as a contract between writer and producer / production company).\nMajor Project (60 credits)\nThis module provides you with an opportunity to create a unique project that explores a chosen area of specialisation \u2013 e.g., Feature Screenplay (Film) or Pilot Episode (TV), with a mind to developing your creative, practical, and collaborative skills.
