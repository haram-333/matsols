Programme Structure
Module A: Process and Practice [Year 1]
Assessment 1: Concept and Development [85 Credits]
This unit covers the early stages of filmmaking, from developing original ideas to planning your first short film. You’ll write a script, create a pitch deck, and compile a full pre-production pack, while building skills in storytelling, character development, budgeting, scheduling, and visual planning.
Assessment 2: Creative Project [35 Credits]
In this practical module, you’ll direct and produce a short film based on a set brief, applying your skills across the full production process — from filming and editing to promotion and reflection. You’ll create an Electronic Press Kit, develop a distribution strategy, and record a reflective essay evaluating your work. This project mirrors industry practice and marks your first complete film as a director.
Module B: Professional Creative Practice [Year 2]
Assessment 1: Personal Professional Development [45 Credits]
This combined unit emphasises collaboration and career readiness. You’ll work in teams to respond to an external brief, simulating real-world creative production. Taking on crew roles, you’ll help plan, produce, and deliver a short film, while also developing your professional identity as a filmmaker.
Assessment 2: Advanced Specialist Practice [75 Credits]
In this unit, you’ll specialise in key areas of filmmaking while creating a significant project that showcases your creative and technical development. Whether producing a short film, documentary, or episodic content, you’ll lead the process from concept to completion—managing production, directing talent, and shaping the narrative and visual style. The unit concludes with a portfolio-ready film and critical reflection, demonstrating your readiness for the screen industries or further study.
