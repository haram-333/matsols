Key Information
The Higher National Diploma (HND) is an internationally recognised UK qualification that provides specialist vocational learning at levels 4 and 5. HNDs are delivered by universities and colleges, and are considered the equivalent of the first two years of a three-year university degree course. Students can often progress onto the final year of the BA Top Up degree programme to obtain a full B.A. (Hons).

PROGRAMME OVERVIEW
________________________________________
Programme Structure
Module A: Process and Practice (Year 1)
Assessment 1: Concept and Development (85 Credits)
In your first unit, you will explore the history and theory of directing, studying how filmmakers shape meaning through visual storytelling. Through hands-on workshops, you will experiment with techniques in camera, sound, and editing while learning to articulate your creative ideas clearly and confidently. You will also begin to understand professional expectations — from set etiquette to working with actors —and how to communicate effectively with a creative team.
Assessment 2: Creative Project (35 Credits)
Put your new skills into action by developing and directing a short film in response to a set brief. You will move through the full production cycle — from interpreting the brief and planning your shoot to leading on set and presenting your final cut. This project marks your first major step as a director, demonstrating your ability to translate vision into screen reality.
Module B: Professional Creative Practice (Year 2)
Assessment 1: Personal Professional Development (45 Credits)
This unit is about shaping your future as a working director. You will reflect on your strengths, influences, and ambitions — and refine the skills needed to succeed professionally. From building pitch materials and portfolios to developing strategies for creative problem-solving, this unit helps you define your path and navigate the next steps with confidence.
Assessment 2: Professional Project (75 Credits)
In this unit, you will take full creative control of an original short film project,
choosing your own genre, format, and stylistic approach. Whether it’s a character-led drama, a music-driven visual piece, or something experimental, this is your opportunity to explore your identity as a director. You’ll manage every stage of production — from concept development and team leadership to delivery and critical reflection — resulting in a polished, portfolio-ready film that showcases your unique vision.
