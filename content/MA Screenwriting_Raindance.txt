Programme & Course Structure
Course Structure
The Programme consists in six modules that will develop the necessary craft and industry skills to become a working screenwriter, with knowledge of general storytelling rules as well as how they apply to specific film forms.
Narratology & Research (15 credits)
This module will provide you with a grounding in narratology in relation to writing for the screen. In particular, you will investigate and analyse how story structures from Aristotle’s ‘Poetics’ through Vladimir Propp’s ‘Narratemes’ to Kim Hudson’s ‘The Virgin’s Promise’ have influenced and shaped character and story development for the big and small screens. The module will also introduce you to research methodologies that are used to create and interpret knowledge in the discipline of filmmaking, and that will help you to develop and hone your analytical and research skills in preparation for future modules.
Ideation: Generating, Testing, and Pitching Ideas for the Screen Industries (15 credits)
This module provides you with an opportunity to develop a deep understanding of the idea-generating process, and to pitch and test your ideas accordingly. You will learn how to assess, develop, and stress test an idea for a screen work. In the process, you will write premises and one-page pitch documents, and you will present your ideas to your peers and tutors for feedback. You will also undertake a short research project into an aspect of the film or TV industry that will serve as a springboard into the writing.
Writing the Short Film (30 credits)
This module provides you with the opportunity to learn the nuts and bolts of screenwriting, with special attention given to the meta elements – character, theme, and story. You will also work through the stages of development from premise to final draft to develop a calling card short screenplay, which you will have the opportunity to pitch to directors and producers within the Raindance community. Testing the strength of the work at each stage of development will allow you to become familiar with the workshopping process with further attention given to giving and receiving feedback.
Episodic Screenwriting: Writing for Television (30 credits)
This module provides you with the opportunity to explore writing TV drama, with an emphasis on creating a (30 min) pilot episode showcasing an original story world. You will work towards an understanding of the differences of developing a project for TV as opposed to the big screen, and work at generating multiple storylines. This will give you insight into the role of storyliner. You will investigate the various TV formats and platforms and develop a series bible. There will also be an opportunity for you to pitch your work to an industry panel to gain professional feedback.
The Art of Adaptation (30 credits)
This module provides you with the opportunity to explore adapting a narrative for the screen. You will assess the suitability of source materials from newspaper articles to poems and short stories, and work towards an understanding of what makes an effective adaptation. You will also develop an awareness and understanding of the difference in approach to adapting material for the screen as opposed to creating original works, and you will write a mission statement (that serves as a contract between writer and producer / production company).
Major Project (60 credits)
This module provides you with an opportunity to create a unique project that explores a chosen area of specialisation – e.g., Feature Screenplay (Film) or Pilot Episode (TV), with a mind to developing your creative, practical, and collaborative skills. The module content builds from your previous modules allowing you to create, write, and develop a longer piece of work. The project will be negotiated with the module leader and must be designed with a focus on developing identified skills that will help you advance your future practice.
Although an individual project, you are encouraged to work collaboratively with your cohort to test, develop, and realise your project and to critically support your fellow students. At the end of this module, you will have the opportunity to pitch your project to an industry panel.
